# Hello Lob crew!

This is my submission for the Lob coding exercise, I hope you like it. I had a *ton* of fun coding it up.

**DISCLAIMER:** I know the requirements said 1-3 hours to finish. Hooking up and figuring out the logic
between the Google API and the Lob API didn't take me longer than an hour or two, but the rest of the
project (design, front-end, etc) took me a few days, I hope that's not a problem. I just had so many ideas
for how I wanted it to look (I'm really into product design/UX design) that I *might* have gotten a bit carried away.

## Setup
Setup is simple, just unzip the file and then navigate to **api_key.js**
In there, you can copy + paste your [Google Civic API key](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/using_api) and Lob API key to get the application working.

## Usage
Usage is also simple, I wanted to make sure the user flow was unintrusive and simple enough to understand all the while providing the best user experience possible.

Just so I cover all bases, all you need to do is click **Get Started** and then enter your information (name, address info) and then choose the government legislator you want to write to in the dropdown menu and then compose away!

## Final Thoughts
I hope you guys like it, I put a lot of work into it (I put off studying for tests so I could work on this, it was **that** fun) and I hope to hear back from you guys.

Also kudos to the design/engineering team, it's a really great product and I love what you guys are doing!
